                <p>  First you explained everything in a very clear manner, then you applied everything you taught in building a page starting with the html page and then moving on to the css which is really impressive.  I really appreciated the tiny tricks like changing the line-height on the H1, using the section and header html tags, centering text on a mobile (it looks better), using Emmet.

                    I wish you did an extension showing how Flex works in Bootstrap and how to apply it.
